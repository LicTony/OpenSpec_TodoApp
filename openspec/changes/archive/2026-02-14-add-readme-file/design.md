## Context

The project currently lacks a `README.md` file. This change introduces one to provide essential project information.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Create a `README.md` file in the project root.
- Populate it with a title, a brief description, and build/run instructions.

**Non-Goals:**
- Creating extensive documentation for every part of the application.
- Automating documentation generation at this stage.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Initial Content

The `README.md` will be created with basic, yet effective, content.

**Approach:**
- **Title:** "TodoApp"
- **Description:** "A simple console application for managing a to-do list."
- **Build/Run:** Basic `dotnet run` command.

**Rationale:**
This provides immediate value by explaining what the project is and how to get it running, without over-complicating the initial setup. The content can be expanded upon in the future as the project grows.
